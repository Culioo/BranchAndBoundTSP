\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
file \hyperlink{graph_8hpp}{graph.\+hpp}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file was used as a graph class header, but someone did not like it and now its only use is to serve his owner with a Node class. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{tree_8hpp}{tree.\+hpp}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Definition of the One\+Tree class and general thoughts about a tree structure. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{tsp_8hpp}{tsp.\+hpp}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em header file for the main \hyperlink{namespaceTSP}{T\+SP} framework including the \hyperlink{namespaceTSP}{T\+SP} \hyperlink{classInstance}{Instance} and the Branching\+Node templates \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{tsp__impl_8hpp}{tsp\+\_\+impl.\+hpp}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Implementation details for the \hyperlink{tsp_8hpp}{tsp.\+hpp}. One might ask, why we are using a .hpp. Well, templates have to be beforehand which is achieved by putting them into the header. This also holds for their implementation. There is one other way, but this is the way conforming the current I\+SO. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
